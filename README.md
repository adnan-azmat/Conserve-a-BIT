# Conserve-a-BIT


## Idea:

The idea is to develop a crowdfunding platform for non-profits and government organisations to raise donations for environmental efforts like forest protection, wildlife conservation, solar power projects and preservation of historical landmarks. Through crowdfunding, people
can donate to revolving funds on our platform. The savings / royalty earned from the projects is used to fund future projects.

## Features:

Donors get a trusted platform and a sense of ownership, which will engage new patrons and retain existing ones. A blockchain based solution will ensure transparent yet secure and immutable transaction records. The platform will allow contributors to log in and view/choose: The projects they have supported Environmental benefits from their donation Savings received by the organisation/community Amount of their donation thatâ€™s been reinvested The projects they want to re-invest in from their revolving funds.
